# Predictive-Modeling-for-Lung-Cancer-Risk-Assessment
Announcing My First Data Science Project: Lung Cancer Risk Prediction on GitHub

I’m excited to share that I’ve completed and uploaded my first data science project to GitHub [insert GitHub link]. This project focuses on predicting lung cancer risk using machine learning, applied to a dataset of patient attributes and symptoms. It’s a milestone in my journey as a data scientist, and I’m eager to present it to the community.

Project Overview
The dataset includes 309 patient records with 15 features—demographic factors (age, gender), lifestyle variables (smoking, alcohol consumption), and clinical symptoms (e.g., fatigue, wheezing, chest pain)—paired with a binary outcome (lung cancer: YES/NO). My goal was to develop and evaluate predictive models to uncover patterns linked to lung cancer diagnosis.
